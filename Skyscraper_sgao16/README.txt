Project 2

	In this project, I used 4 public methods and 4 private methods. All these 4 private methods serves for printWithVisibility method. For loadPuzzle method, I just simply asked users to set the dimension and inputs for the puzzle. And print method is just print out the puzzle we just set. For verifyPlacement method, it is a little bit tricker and I think for a while. I finally find the easiest method, check each rows and columns overtime and set each index as a value to check. For example, set the dimension to be 3, we want to check the number at puzzle[1][1], I set a k as the remaining number in the rest of the row or column. Then compare puzzle[1][1] with [1][2] and [1][3] or [2][1] and[3][1]. If they share same value, it is not valid since we only contains each number exactly once at every row and every column. For printWithVisibility method, it is the hardest for me at first. And I checked through our previous practice in the zybooks and other practice, I notice find max method works very good in this situation. So I use this method to check the rows and columns forward and backward, and then gathering those 4 private methods in the printWithVisiblity method to set the format correctly.
	All in all, I feel like it is harder than last time, but I actually spend less time in a wrong direction. I enjoy doing such challenge and enjoy the game!
